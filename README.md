# Design Tokens
## Style Dictionary

A demonstration branch for using Style Dictionary for your Design Tokens

### Set Up

To use the `CLI` you will need to install Style Dictionary globally (you may need to prefix with `sudo`):

```
npm install -g style-dictionary
```

I've also installed this locally to the project, as at some point I'll be getting this working with Gulp.

```
npm install
```

Also checkout the [`README.md`](/Style-Dictionary-README.md) that gets created after running `style-dictionary init basic`.
